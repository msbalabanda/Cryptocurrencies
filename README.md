# Cryptocurrencies

## Analysis Overview ##

In this project we used unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to heir features. This classification report will then be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients.
Our analysis involves preprocessing the data for PCA, reducing the data dimension using PCA, clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means and visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.

## Results ##

## Clustering Crytocurrencies Using K-Means

The elbow curve method is used to determine the best number for K. K is used to determine the number of clusters we should use to analyze our data set.
Our results show that the best value is K is 4. In this case 4 clusters can be used to categorize cryptocurrencies.

## Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Tradable Cryptocurrencies Table
The table with tradable cryptocurrencies shows us that there are 532 tradable currencies. It also allows us to know which coin names belong to various classes.

## 2D-Scatter plot with TotalCoinMined vs TotalCoinSupply
The 2D-scatter plot helps us visually determine the supply of the different classes of coins being mined. This can help the investement bank determine which coin names are worth the investment.

## Summary

The visualization results from our analysis helped us itentify that there are 532 tradeable cryptocurrencies. The table and scatter plots provide some insight on which classes of cryptonames investors can potentially invest in.
